# FriendFinder
Compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app.

A full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

The survey consists of 10 questions. Each answer uses a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being strongly disagree and 5 strongly agree) based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.
